# API Development Progress

This document tracks the goals, progress, and challenges during the development of the RESTful API.

## Goals

- **Completed:** Create a complete RESTful API for user authentication and authorization.
- **Completed:** Use Laravel 12, Sanctum, and `spatie/laravel-permission`.
- **Completed:** The API will serve an existing Angular single-page application (SPA).
- **Completed:** Implement endpoints for registration, login, logout, and fetching user data.
- **Completed:** Include role-based access control (RBAC) with "User", "Admin", and "Super Admin" roles.
- **Completed:** Seed the database with initial roles, permissions, and sample users.
- **Completed:** Implemented a user management endpoint (`/api/users`) to list all users.
- **Completed:** Protected the user management endpoint using role-based access control (`Admin` & `Super Admin` only).
- **Completed:** Implemented full CRUD (Show, Update, Delete) functionality for the user management endpoints.
- **Completed:** Implement API endpoints for full CRUD management of Roles.
- **Completed:** Implement an API endpoint to list all available Permissions.
- **Completed:** Secure all Role and Permission management endpoints to be accessible only by the "Super Admin" role.
- **Completed:** Implement full CRUD operations for Category management.
- **Completed:** Set up database relationships between Categories (parent-child hierarchy).
- **Completed:** Implement image upload functionality for categories.
- **Completed:** Implement full CRUD operations for Product management with comprehensive fields.
- **Completed:** Set up Product-Category relationships with sub-category support.
- **Completed:** Implement multiple image handling for products with dedicated ProductImage model.
- **Completed:** Add advanced filtering and search capabilities for products.
- **Completed:** Implement inventory management with stock tracking.
- **Completed:** Implement proper API validation error handling with JSON responses.

## Handoff Notes for Frontend Integration

- The API is now complete and ready for frontend integration.
- It uses stateless token-based authentication (Bearer Token).
- CORS is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:4200`.
- Category management endpoints are fully functional and ready for frontend integration.
- Product management endpoints are fully functional with proper validation and error handling.
- All endpoints return proper JSON responses (no HTML redirects).
- See below for interactive documentation and test credentials.

## Progress

## Current API Status & Testing Results

### **‚úÖ Fully Functional Endpoints:**

#### **Authentication & User Management:**
- `POST /api/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/login` - User authentication (returns Bearer token)
- `POST /api/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/user` - Get authenticated user info
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (Admin/Super Admin only)
- `GET /api/roles` - List all roles (Super Admin only)
- `GET /api/permissions` - List all permissions (Super Admin only)

#### **Category Management:**
- `GET /api/categories` - List all categories with hierarchy
- `POST /api/categories` - Create new category
- `GET /api/categories/{id}` - Get specific category
- `PUT /api/categories/{id}` - Update category
- `DELETE /api/categories/{id}` - Delete category

#### **Product Management:**
- `GET /api/products` - List all products with filtering, search, and pagination
- `POST /api/products` - Create new product with validation
- `GET /api/products/{id}` - Get specific product with relationships
- `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Delete product

#### **Product Images:**
- `GET /api/products/{id}/images` - Get all images for a product
- `POST /api/products/{id}/images` - Add images to a product
- `GET /api/products/{id}/images/{image}` - Get specific image
- `PUT /api/products/{id}/images/{image}` - Update image
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}/images/{image}` - Delete image

### **‚úÖ Testing Results:**
- **Product Creation**: ‚úÖ Working - Successfully created test products
- **Validation Errors**: ‚úÖ Working - Returns proper JSON validation errors (422 status)
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Working - Proper Bearer token validation
- **Relationships**: ‚úÖ Working - Category and sub-category loading correctly
- **Price Calculations**: ‚úÖ Working - Discount calculations working properly
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Working - JSON responses for all error scenarios

## Next Steps

- **Product Management System**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full CRUD operations implemented
- **Product Images**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Multiple images per product with proper storage management
- **Inventory Management**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Stock tracking implemented
- **Search & Filtering**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Product search and category-based filtering implemented
- **API Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing of all endpoints
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation updated with product endpoints
- **Validation & Error Handling**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Proper JSON validation errors for API endpoints

## Challenges

- **Resolved:** Encountered a `BindingResolutionException` (Target class [role] does not exist) when using role-based middleware.
  - **Solution:** Manually aliased the `role` middleware from the Spatie package in `bootstrap/app.php`, as this is now required in Laravel 11.
- **Resolved:** Encountered a `NotFoundHttpException` because API routes were not loaded by default in Laravel 11.
  - **Solution:** Explicitly registered the API routes file in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- **Resolved:** Ran into a `CSRF token mismatch` error when testing from Swagger UI.
  - **Solution:** Switched to stateless authentication by removing the `EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful` middleware, as stateful CSRF protection is not needed for token-based API testing and will be configured later for the SPA frontend.
- **Resolved:** Faced a `MissingRateLimiterException` because the `api` rate limiter was not defined in the minimal Laravel 11 installation.
  - **Solution:** Defined the default rate limiter in the `AppServiceProvider`.
- **Resolved:** Encountered `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 table categories has no column named image` when creating categories.
  - **Solution:** Fixed database schema mismatch by updating CategoryController to only save fields that exist in the database table (`name`, `description`, `parent_id`). The `image` field is processed separately and stored to the `image_url` column.
- **Resolved:** Category model was using `protected $guarded = []` which allowed invalid fields to be mass assigned.
  - **Solution:** Changed to `protected $fillable = ['name', 'description', 'image_url', 'parent_id']` for better control over mass assignment.
- **Resolved:** Encountered `Route [login] not defined` error when accessing protected product endpoints.
  - **Solution:** Created custom `ApiAuthenticate` middleware to handle API authentication properly and return JSON responses instead of redirecting to non-existent login routes.
- **Resolved:** Product validation errors were returning HTML redirects instead of JSON responses in Laravel 12.
  - **Solution:** Configured exception handling in `bootstrap/app.php` to properly catch validation exceptions for API routes and return JSON error responses with 422 status codes.
- **Resolved:** Product and ProductImage models were using `protected $guarded = []` which could cause database errors.
  - **Solution:** Updated both models to use proper `fillable` arrays for better control over mass assignment and data integrity.
